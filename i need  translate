outputs the target outputs either be946
Skinner's and I once again the same by n947
which is the output of the final layer948
of the network so maybe I have missed949
this when I was talking about this950
so so the output of the final layer of951
the network which I represent using an952
uppercase bar is also going to be a953
vector so this is the response of the954
network go to the screen but and this is955
the design response for that input since956
yeah so DN is the Yahoo user either957
there this one no no these the desired958
output remember this is input output959
this that we're trying to man so960
designing a network anonymous donation961
from extra beam but the actual output of962
the network is varnish so we're going to963
call up all outputs wise the final layer964
is this format propagates platform this965
was a rotation and introduced right here966
writing everything they are all to the967
Indonesian ops or part it P is the968
design desired and sometimes you know969
I'm not going to use this additional970
notation this index n because it gets971
very confusing so now what about an
input the input is just a vector of973
numbers like in ionizing features vector974
of pixel values or if I'm analyzing
speech speech so other real random976
vectors977
what's more interesting is how we978
represent the output because really we979
are performing if you're performing980
regression output is sister we are981
number easy if you're performing
classification you're going to pass data983
set it off is this a dog or this is a984
cat how do you assign numbers to this985
sort of thing so for the real career986
that it outputs the yes you know we are987
guided vehicles no big deal but if the988
output is binary let's say is this a cat989
is the smile then you're gonna have to990
convert their to numbers which means991
the number one cat and zero to not cap992
and this perceptron just this output993
unit is expected to have a binary on994
reality what you won't actually get you995
won't actually be using a special unit996
you'd be using a same point everything997
is differentiable right so that was from998
0 to 1 so you would view this is the999
probability of y equals 1 given the1000
input and we saw this last class so this1001
is going to be in that case what is the1002
probability in the picture that we just1003
saw account for instance now if I have1004
vector out words meaning suppose I want1005
to decide about performing1006
classification like deciding in the1007
pictures that have a cat a dog a cat in1008
some pre specified format we specified1009
water like cattle cattle cattle and now1010
each output is going to be discussed by1011
the competence so each output is now1012
going to be a five component vector and1013
the desired output is going to be what1014
we call a one hot vector why is it one1015
not there's going to be a single entry1016
which has the value 1 all the other1017
Rises and easier so here this one hot1018
vector has one in the first component1019
and 0 everywhere else1020
which means I'm assigning one to can and1021
0 to the others this means I'm1022
representing which was can't so also1023
this has a 1 in the second problem and1024
everything else is 0 the second1025
component was assigned to dogs if I have1026
a value the third component in this1027
example and representing it was handed1028
and so on this is a one contractor and 41029
and input of crops we will have five1030

minutes to write two out of the four1031
zeros and a single position 1 and1032
position for that matter what were the1033
network art would actually be so that's1034
it if I give you training inputs1035
give me some vector X and I'm going to1036
give you a desired output P which is a1037
one Hotlanta because I want to say I1038
want the network to see this picture and1039
say it's a camp so the desired output is1040
going to be zero one zero zero zero the1041
actual output of the network remember we1042
have differentiable functions it's not1043
going to mean that's that1044
straightforward so the function output1045
must ideally be a 1 here and 01046
everywhere else more realistically it's1047
going to be a probability vector so in1048
the multi-class classification what is1049
this probability vector will it be using1050
this soft max that we have salt I could1051
just use a soft max layer and we already1052
saw the soft max layer is going to give1053
you a set of probability H values and we1054
are going to try to learn this network1055
so that they're actually reasonably1056
accurately represents the people studio1057
in probability of the 12 given the input1058
from each of the classes so that is one1059
of the softmax later is going1060
probability that I was right so it has a1061
typical problem statement will be given1062
a bunch of data training data instances1063
like images of idiots along with1064
information about which digital a1065
businessman which image represents which1066
midget for binary recognition you have1067
asked what is this a to a lot for multi1068
classes it's going to be which digit is1069
it is or even is it a digit in the first1070
place so if you were trying to perform1071
by the name recognition does this image1072
represent the input-output pairs are not1073
mere pictures black patches and the1074
maple so we were shown a trend yes this1075
is a 2-month notice is not you so five1076
is clearing this is clearly not an image1077
of two so really the zero this is an1078
instant instance of to make this one1079
this is not a tool so this is zero this1080
is a true so we gave this one it's one1081
and you have a network of the sky but1082
after is going to be Sigma1083
if you had a multi-class classification1084
whether you're trying to be to mind a1085
silent loss value of the digit to the1086
important then the middle is actually1087
going to be the practical size itself of1088
course when you convert it for the1089
purpose of the networks this number five1090
is going to be if I'm recognizing nine1091
digits or ten digits that number five is1092
going to be a one hot n dimensional1093
vector with a one and the fifth position1094
and zero everywhere else1095
what so you're going to have a bunch of1096
these training examples and our problem1097
is to burn all the weeks of the network1098
to the desired job then define1099
input-output pairs the designer define a1100
function we've defined one motor which1101
is this divergence what is this darling1102
the divergence quantifies the difference1103
between these now if the odd one of the1104
target output of the network is really1105
matter when chatting laughter so if1106
we're talking output is of the network1107
is real valued then I can just if I1108
understand in Euclidean distance so1109
here's a y minus T squared norm is the1110
square Euclidean distance between the1111
actual output Y which is also back1112
damage we toss on the staff to half just1113
for the sake of convenience to donation1114
so that's going to be half of sum over1115
all the components of the squared1116
difference between the actual output of1117
the network and the designer and why the1118
half because if you differentiate it1119
with respect in any given Y eyes it's1120
simply going to be Y minus T which is1121
the variance and so specifically because1122
of this because the derivative is simply1123
the actual difference the error the1124
entire process1125
training using a gradient descent1126
it's called error back propagation1127
because we are going to be using a chain1128
rule to compute the derivatives of the1129
error with respect to intermediate1130
values and it turns out it just ends up1131
doing a lot of multiplies additions of1132
this basic errors is called data bank1133
domination but anyway the system Asylum1134
so for the l2 for real money director1135
that's how we define as evidence if1136
you're performing binary classification1137
then we need some kind of any divergence1138
metric that tells you how much your1139
network is part so the network let's say1140
you want a 1 0 and the network outputs 01141
1 how much is it well the network was a1142
1 0 you could use the help of evidence1143
again it turns out it's not very1144
effective so we actually use something1145
called the cross entropy in this case1146
which is this one so d is a the desired1147
output it is either 0 or 11148
